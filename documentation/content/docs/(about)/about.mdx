## {PROJECT_NAME}
Supporting teachers in creating scientific educational content

### Product in development

Conceived as part of the 3rd call for projects by the Ministry of Culture (Digital Workshop of the Digital Service), {PROJECT_NAME} is a personal assistant available to science teachers. It allows them to quickly and easily generate their course materials using content verified and approved by Universcience. Photos, videos, writing assistance, quizzes: customize your course materials in just a few minutes.

### Context
Teachers spend a lot of time searching, verifying, and adapting content to prepare their lesson materials while ensuring they are aligned with the school curriculum, sourced from reliable, freely accessible sources. This preparation work must often be repeated when the class or curriculum changes, adding to the challenge of tailoring the content to the needs and issues of individual students.

### Problem
Universcience, which includes the Palais de la Découverte and the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, offers numerous verified and often engaging content (written, video, iconographic) that can meet teachers' needs. However, searching for these materials can be tedious and doesn't always meet the need for customization and structured lesson creation, which consumes a lot of teachers' time. How can we better support teachers in preparing their lessons using this content? What mechanisms can we use to save them time? By launching an initial investigative phase, Universcience seeks to better understand the methodology used by teachers when creating lesson materials.

### Investigation
To address this issue, we interviewed a panel of primary and secondary teachers to understand the steps involved in creating their lesson materials, the key moments, and the challenges they face. After about fifteen interviews with different profiles, it became clear that providing content from reliable sources aligned with the school curriculum is essential. In addition, it is crucial to better understand students' educational levels to quickly adapt the lesson and make it more impactful and digestible. This initial investigation phase highlighted the importance of creating a tool specifically designed for teachers, the need for increased efficiency, and the identification of a trusted space offering verified content.

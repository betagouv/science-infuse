### Document Upload
1. User uploads document (PDF, image, YouTube URL, MP4, etc.)
2. Webapp validates file type
3. If applicable, webapp server uploads file to S3 storage
</Step>

### Document Processing
1. Webapp backend sends document to Python processing service
2. Processing service extracts text/content based on file type
3. Content is split into chunks
4. Processing service returns Document and DocumentChunk objects
</Step>

<Step>

### Database Insertion
1. Webapp backend receives processed document and chunks
2. Vector embeddings is generated for chunks's texts
4. Document and chunk data inserted into database tables

</Step>

<Step>

### Indexing Completion
1. Database confirms successful insertion
2. User notified of completed indexing
3. Document now available for vector similarity search
</Step>

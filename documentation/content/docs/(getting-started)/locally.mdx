# Setting up {PROJECT_NAME}

<Callout type="info">
{PROJECT_NAME}'s main logic consists of two components:

1. The NextJS backend handles:
   - Database operations: Storing users, processed documents, chapters, education levels, etc.

2. The Python backend manages:
   - The document processing pipeline
</Callout>

{PROJECT_NAME} is a monorepo managed by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- conda with Python 3.9 (you can use venv)
- npm and Node.js
- A computer / server with CUDA 12 installed
- Postgresql

<Callout title="Postgresql" type="info">
You can run use the docker compose to launch an instance of postgresql
```sh
docker compose up postgresql
``` 
If you prefer to run it "locally" you can come up with your own instance, by changing the relevant environment variables
</Callout>

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
```sh
git clone git@github.com:betagouv/science-infuse.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd science-infuse
```

# The server
<Callout type="info">
the server is used in two ways:
1. To run the processing pipeline in order to index the documents (pdf, video, ...). <br/> It does this using the [AI models](/docs/technology#ai-models) that run locally
2. To serve the embedding models, used by the web client to process every user queries.
</Callout>

## Setup the server

1. Create a virtual environment using conda with python 3.9
```sh
conda create --name scienceinfuse python=3.9
conda activate scienceinfuse
```

2. Go inside the server folder:
```sh
cd server
```

3. Install the required dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Callout title="Dependency missing" type="warn">
If when running the server, you encounter a error saying that a dependency is missing.
1. Make sure that the requirements.txt has been installed correctly (without error)
2. refer to the Dockerfile (`server/Dockerfile`) to see if a your missing dependency is not specified there (look for a `RUN pip install xxx` inside the Dockerfile)
</Callout>

4. Make sure you have correctly [set-up the environment variables](/docs/environment)

## Launch the server
The server needs to access the environment variables. To inject them, you can run it with this command:
```sh
env $(grep -v '^#' ../.env | xargs) python app/main.py
```
This command will inject the environment variables located in the root folder's .env file into the context of the command.

# The next-app
<Callout type="info">
The next-app is built using the following technologies : 
- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) 14 (with app router)
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart#2-model-your-data-in-the-prisma-schema) used to connect to the Postgresql database.
</Callout>

## Setup the next-app

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd next-app
```

2. Install the required dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

3. Sync the database
```sh
npx prisma db push
```

4. Feed the db with initial content
```sh
npm run db:seed
```

## Launch the next-app

```sh
npm run dev
```

if everything worked well you can visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you should see something like this:

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, please check the following:

- Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed.
- Verify that the required ports are not being used by other applications.
- Check the logs for any error messages.

If problems persist, please contact [erwan.boehm@beta.gouv.fr](mailto:erwan.boehm@beta.gouv.fr) or [open an issue](https://github.com/betagouv/science-infuse/issues/new) on the GitHub repository.

# Setting up {PROJECT_NAME}

{PROJECT_NAME} is a monorepo managed by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
```sh
git clone git@github.com:betagouv/science-infuse.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd science-infuse
```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
   
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

   This command will download necessary images, build the containers, and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. Once the build process is complete and the services are running, you can visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you should see something like this:

## Development

- To stop the services, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.
- To run the services in detached mode, use `docker compose up -d`.
- To view logs, use `docker compose logs`.
- To rebuild the containers after making changes in the code, use `docker compose up --build`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, please check the following:

- Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed.
- Verify that the required ports are not being used by other applications.
- Check the Docker logs for any error messages.

If problems persist, please contact [erwan.boehm@beta.gouv.fr](mailto:erwan.boehm@beta.gouv.fr) or [open an issue](https://github.com/betagouv/science-infuse/issues/new) on the GitHub repository.

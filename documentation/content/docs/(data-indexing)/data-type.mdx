You can find the data structure in the **Prisma** schema located at `webapp/src/prisma/schema.prisma`. <br/>
We use PostgreSQL with pgvector extension to store the data.

## Types of Documents
{PROJECT_NAME} can injest multiple types of documents:
- Pdfs
- Images
- Youtube Videos
- Websites
- ...

## Document Structure

Documents are processed and stored in a three-level hierarchy:

1. **Document Level**
   - The top-level entity representing the document
   - Contains basic file information: i.e. name, original path, s3 access...
2. **Chunks Level**
   - Documents are broken down into smaller text chunks for easier indexing
   - Each chunk's text is transformed into <a href="/technology#text-embeddings" target="_blank">vector embeddings</a>
   - These embeddings are used for semantic search

3. **Metadata Level**
   - Each chunk can have associated metadata
   - Stores contextual information about the chunk: i.e. page number, bounding box

## Semantic Search Implementation

The semantic search capability is enabled by:
1. Breaking documents into manageable chunks
2. Converting chunk text into vector embeddings
3. Storing these embeddings in pgvector
4. Using vector similarity for search operations
